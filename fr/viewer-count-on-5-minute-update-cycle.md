# Viewer Count on 5 Minute Update Cycle [(by MarkusoOoO)](https://www.twitch.tv/markusoooo)

## Description
For anyone who would like to use SB only for viewers counter, which will be updated every 5 minutes. You can use variable which exists only when you hit Start Streaming and you have to have action assigned into `Present Viewers (occurs every 5 minutes)` event.

If both of those conditions are met, variable named `%viewerCount%` will be populated with number. Otherwise this variable will not exist. That was causing some issues, but I figured out, that if you create `Fallback action`, for times, when that variable is not existing, this variable can work just fine.

## Streamer.bot action
In Streamer.bot in `Actions` tab, right click at white space and select `Import`. Copy the string (bunch of text) below and paste it into the `Import Sring`.

## How it works?
Here are my two actions. Both of them are just pointing to same Text GDI in OBS.

Action called `Viewer Count` should be one inside event I already mentioned. You can find that event in SB under `Settings` > `General` > `Present Viewers (occurs every 5 minutes)` (or you can put those subactions from `Viewer Count` into already existing Action if you already have one sitting there).

And second action called `Fallback Viewer Count` is being called from `Viewer Count` if variable `%viewerCount%` is not existing and changing our Text GDI to number 0 (or anything you change it to).

I know this is really basic, but hopefully it will help someone, who wants to use Streamer.bot only in their setup.
