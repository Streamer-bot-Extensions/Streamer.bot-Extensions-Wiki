## Heat Map FAQ

###### Heat Map Keeps Saying 'Someone' Clicked.. Why?
This occurs when the user hasn't given the extension access to there information. What you need to do is advice your community that they must give Heat access if they wish to unlock the full potential. To give access your viewers must press on the heat menu which can be found on the right hand side, then Manage Access > Grant. More Information and pictures can be found in the Core install Page.
