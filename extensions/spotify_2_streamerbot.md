> In order to get full functionality like song request [command !sr ] to add song to song queue , you MUST be premium spotify user. it's not only because not being premium will cast ads too, but it's also spotify API limitation.
Open your desktop application during the process so it will be recognized by streamer.bot on the first connection.
! ► If you already have the first version , remove all Actions and Commands before updating to avoid conflicts◄ {.is-warning}
