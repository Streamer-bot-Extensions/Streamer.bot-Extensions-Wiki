# Installation
In Streamer.bot in select `Import` from the top left.
Copy the `Import Code` and paste it into the `Import String`. 

![viewer-count-on-5-minute-update-cycle.png](/assets/viewer-count-on-5-minute-update-cycle/images/viewer-count-on-5-minute-update-cycle.png)

Here are my two actions. Both of them are just pointing to same Text GDI in OBS.

Action called `Viewer Count` should be one inside event I already mentioned. You can find that event in SB under `Platforms`>`Twitch`>`Events`>`General`>`Present Viewers (occurs every 5 minutes)` (or you can put those subactions from `Viewer Count` into already existing Action if you already have one sitting there).

And second action called `Fallback Viewer Count` is being called from `Viewer Count` if variable `%viewerCount%` is not existing and changing our Text GDI to number 0 (or anything you change it to).

I know this is really basic, but hopefully it will help someone, who wants to use Streamer.bot only in their setup.
