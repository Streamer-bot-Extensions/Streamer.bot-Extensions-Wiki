# Install
1. Download and unzip [newspaper-quotes](/extensions/quote-newspaper/newspaper-quotes.zip) to a folder of your choice.
2.  Copy `Import Code` from above and import into Streamer.bot using the `Import` button in top left of the bot.
3. Add a Browser source in OBS. Give it a name like Newspaper Quotes or something and then in the Properties:
<span class="mdi mdi-arrow-right-bold-outline"></span> ***Do not tick*** "Local file" <span class="mdi mdi-arrow-left-bold-outline"></span> 
<span class="mdi mdi-arrow-right-bold-outline"></span> ***Do not worry that we are not giving it a URL*** <span class="mdi mdi-arrow-left-bold-outline"></span>
Give it a size of 1175 by 1080. Dont worry, you can clcik-drag to resize in OBS but it is important to set the ***width to 1175*** and set the ***height to 1080***
Tick `Shutdown source when not visible`.
Tick `Refresh browser source when scene becomes active`.

Click `OK`. 
4. Using Windows Explorer navigate to the folder you exported the contents of the zip to and then into a folder of one of the magazine covers. 
5. Open the index.html file into your broswer of choice & click inside the address bar of the browser window and copy the location (Should start with `file:///` and end with `\index.html`)
6. In Streamer.bot go to the actions you just imported and edit the one with the name that matches the same as the index.html address you just copied. Double-click the OBS Set Browser Source URL to edit it.

Chose your Scene, Source and paste the address you copied into the URL box as shown above. Next take this string and paste it to the end of the RUL you just added. `?title=Local streamer says: %quote%&nameText=%quoteuser% wanted for misquoting streamer&issueNum=Issue No. %quoteId%&img=%targetUserProfileImageUrl%` so that the end of the string looks like this:
`/index.html?title=Local streamer says: %quote%&nameText=%quoteuser% wanted for misquoting streamer&issueNum=Issue No. %quoteId%&img=%targetUserProfileImageUrl%`
7. Click `OK`
8. Edit the `Take Screenshot` sub-action by double clicking it
Set the ***Scene and Source where your webcam*** is and then clcik the three dots across from `File Path` and navigate to the folder created and extracted the zip. Select the `cam-shot.png` file.

9. Double click each of the 2 OBS Set Soruce Visibility and set the ***Scene and Source for the OBS Browser*** source you just created
10. In Streamer.bot navigate to Settings > Quotes and Enable quotes then assign the new action you imported to the Quote Add

# Customize It!
You will want to take the time to do some easy, lite editing to the HTML (index.html) file before you use it, at leat in one place and that is for the socials as they come set to Lyfesaver's.

You can use any text editor, even Notepad, but VS Code or Notepad++ will be optimal as they allow for styling and line numbers.

On, or around, line number 63 will be the socials you need to edit. Replace the ones already there with your own. You can delete any that you dont want to show or add/replace as you see fit. For those new to HTML `</br> = a new line`.

Other edits you might want to make
- Line 13 to change the title of the paper from The Streamer Times to your choice
- Line 26 to change the caption under the webcam screenshot
- Line 30 Has some text about Vault-Tec Love Swings. I have toned it down a bit but some might consider it too lewd for their channel. No foul language or descriptions, just vague wording around an adult topic.

One thing to note is that the spinning paper effect is done with Move Transition and not part of the browser code. If you decide to take the time to give the paper a spinning effect be sure to enable the Play Sound sub-action.
