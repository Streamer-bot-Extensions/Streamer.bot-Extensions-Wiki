5. Connect the websocket client to the server.

## 3. Setting up events

1. Create a new action named `MC WS Event-{event name}`. [Events List](/integrated-games/minecraft/events)
2. Add any sub-actions you want to the action.

## 4. Sending Commands

You have 2 ways to send commands to the server.

C#:
  
  ```c#
  CPH.WebsocketSend("Command {command}");
  ```

Sub-Actions:

1. Define a variable named `cmd` and set it to the command you want to send.
2. Add a C# Method subaction, and call `MC WS Message Handler`, and set the method to `SendCommand`.
