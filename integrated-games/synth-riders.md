# SynthRiders Websocket Integration [(by KK964)](https://www.twitch.tv/kk964gaming)

## Description

This is a mod for [SynthRiders](https://synthridersvr.com/). It allows you to connect to the websocket server and receive updates about the game.

## Setup

To install you need to either download a release, or build the mod yourself.

### Pre-requisites

1. [SynthRiders](https://synthridersvr.com/)
2. [MelonLoader](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/)

### Download

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub](https://github.com/KK964/SynthRiders-Websockets-Mod/releases)
2. Extract the zip file
3. Copy the dlls to your SynthRiders MelonLoader Mods folder (typically a folder called `Mods` in your SynthRiders installation.  If you see a text file named "PLACE MODS HERE.txt", you're in the right place.)

### Build

1. Clone the repository
2. Inside visual studio, open `/src` as the project
3. Build the project
4. The resulting dll will be in `/src/bin/Debug/` as `SynthRidersWebsockets.dll`
5. Copy the dll to your SynthRiders MelonLoader Mods folder
6. Copy `websocket-sharp.dll` to the Mods folder

### MelonPreferences.cfg

- Host: The hostname of the websocket server
- Port: The port of the websocket server

---

## Usage

Connect to the websocket server; the server will send updates about the game.  By default, the websocket host will run at `ws://localhost:9000`.  Host and Port can be configured in the MelonPreferences.cfg file if an alternate config is required (e.g. for 2 PC stream setups)

## Events

All events are JSON and follow this general structure:

```json
{ "eventType": "EventType", "data": {} }
```

### SongStart 

Emitted when the map begins playing.

```json
{
    "eventType": "SongStart",
	"data": {

	}
}
```

- `difficulty` - Song difficulty
- `author` - Song artist/author
- `beatMapper` - Map creator
- `length` - Song length in seconds
- `bpm` - Song beats per minute
- `albumArt` - If album art is available, this contains a data url containing a base64-encoded PNG image.  (You can use this URL as-is in a web browser or browser source to display the image).  Otherwise it's an empty string.


### SongEnd

```json
{

    "data": {
        "playTimeMS": 19662.48
    }
}
```

    }
}
```

## Using from another mod

To easily consume these events from another Synth Riders mod:
- Target .NET 4.8 to match this project
- Add a Reference to SynthRidersWebsockets.dll
- Implement the ISynthRidersEventHandler interface
- Create a new `SynthRidersEventsManager` after `Awake()` is called (to make sure the socket is created before connecting)

See [SRPerformanceMeter](https://github.com/bookdude13/SRPerformanceMeter) as an example implementation.
