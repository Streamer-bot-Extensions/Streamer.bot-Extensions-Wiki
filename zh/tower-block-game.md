# Heat (Tower Block Game)

> This import/set-up will only work if you have already installed the core heat package. [Heat Map Core](/en/extensions/heat-map/heat-map-core ""){.is-danger}
## Tutorial

## Set Up
First you will need to visit the [Tower Block](/en/overlays/tower-blocks-and-websocket-example) page to get the assets you need and you can use the Import from that page. Once you've extracted the files and put them somewhere safe, create a browser source somewhere suitable and with that index file, the main page explains this in more detail.

So for the heat to work you are going to need create a new folder in the `Heat Sources` Action. Call it some identifiable, I would call the folder the same name as the source, and put the following actions in. `OBS Get Scene Item Properties` link this to the Tower Game Browser Source. Then add a `Execute Method(Check if Match,Execute)` If you already have an example folder in there you can just duplicate and rename and relink to make the process easier.

The Next set up is to create a duplicate of the action `Game-Tower-Begin`, you will need to rename this action so it is exactly the same as the name of the source. If they are not the same this will not work.

In the Action `Game-Tower-Launcher` you will need to change variable `%user%` to `%userName%` , also make sure the `OBS Source Visibility State` Sub-Actions in `Game-Tower-Launcher` and `Game-Tower-End` are pointed to the correct source also these Action contain enable and disable Sub-Actions Channel Points. If you wish to use a chat command as a trigger then delete the Channel Enable/Disable Sub-Action and replace with the equivalent for commands.

As Explained in the main Tower Block you need to ensure that Streamer.bot WebSocket is enabled ![sbwebsocket.png](/extensions/heat-map/images/sbwebsocket.png)

> That should now have the Tower Block Game working with heat. {.is-success}

## Additional Comments

In the heatmap Action that triggers when is clicked, the one that is called the same as your source, there is a Sub-Action of `if("user" Not Equals "%towerPlayerArgs%") then break` you can have this trigger another action if the player who did not trigger the tower game clicks. So for example you could have it trigger an action that sent a message to chat saying `%user% it is not your turn`
