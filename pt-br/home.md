# Welcome to Streamer.bot Extensions

Documentation for Streamer.bot. Here are the changelogs and information on all aspects of the application.

Additionally, there are channels on the Stremer.bot discord to seek help/support, share discoveries, and present what you're working on.  The application can advance/evolve optimally if we all share new/interesting ways to do things.

If you would like to help build this wiki with information, please get in contact with me on Discord 😃 

* [Discord *Be sure to join the Discord for examples, help, to share what you've made, or just to hang out!*](https://discord.streamer.bot)

Also be sure to share on Twitter and tag **@streamerdotbot**, and/or use the hashtags **#streamerdotbot**, **#streamerbot**!  Uploading videoes on YouTube, be sure to add the **#streamerbot** and/or **#streamerdotbot** hashtags to help others find your videos!

## Extended Features

Don't have a StreamDeck, or a LoupeDeck? Looking for a web based deck you can just setup and use.

Well, be sure to check out **[Streamer.bot Decks](https://streamer.bot/user/decks)**, it is currently a **WIP** feature, created by the very talented **Whipstickgostop**

## Thanks

Wanted to first off, say thank you to everyone who has been using this bot, providing feedback (i.e. breaking it 😁), and being supportive of my efforts to just provide another option for streamers out there to use.

A very big thank you to the amazing folks who have been supporting me through the hectic release:
