# Deprecated Extensions
>The following extensions have been marked as deprecated.  They have either been replaced by a more robust extension, they have been implemented into a newer version of Streamer.bot, or they just no longer work.
No support will be offered when using these as they may or may not work with the current version of Streamer.bot.
