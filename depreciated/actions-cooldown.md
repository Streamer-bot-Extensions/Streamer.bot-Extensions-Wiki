# Action Cooldown

## Description
This project will allow you to set cooldowns based on the action rather than the trigger, for example if you have a SFX that is triggered by a `Deck Button` and by `Chat Command` then you may want to apply a cooldown so only 1 of these are allow to be triggered in the time you state.

## Import Code
```

### Button Cooldown
This will allow you to add a cooldown to an action that is tied to a button only or to an action that you only want the cooldown to apply if its come from a button. , this is useful for shared decks with multiple people.
You will need to add the following json to the `Arguments` inside the button setting, and edit it to your specification.
```json
{
"buttonName":"BUTTONNAME",
"buttonCooldown": 30,
 "buttonPress": true
}
```

### FullActionGlobal
This will allow you to add a Global Cooldown to an action reguardless of how it is triggered. To add this to an action you will need to set up 2 `Set Arguments` one for `actionName` and one for `actionCooldown`. It should look like this.
