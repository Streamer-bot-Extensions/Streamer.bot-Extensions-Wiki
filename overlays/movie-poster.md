![movie-poster-import](/overlays/movie-poster/images/movie-poster-import.png)

### OBS Studio
Create a new `Browser Source` and make sure `Local File` is **NOT** checked.
The source can be set to the canvas size or to a size that you prefer.

>The URL doesn't matter as we will have Streamer.bot automagically set this.
{.is-info}

## Configuration
Double click on the `Obs Set Browser Source Url` `Subaction` and make sure that it points to the `index.html` file in `\Browser Sources\movie-poster`.
![movie-poster-browser-source-url](/overlays/movie-poster/images/movie-poster-browser-source-url.png)

>Do NOT remove the `?user=%user%&targetUserProfileImageUrl=%targetUserProfileImageUrl%` from the end of the `Obs Set Browser Source Url` `Subactions` or it will NOT work.
{.is-danger}

>Do NOT check `Local File` in the `OBS Browser Source`.
{.is-danger}

Double click on the `Sound` `Subaction` and make sure that it points to the `movie-sound.mp3` file in `\Sounds`.
![movie-poster-sound](/overlays/movie-poster/images/movie-poster-sound.png)

Make sure both `OBS Set Source Visibility` `Subactions` are pointing to your OBS connection and the new `Browser Source` you created.

Create a `Channel Point Reward` and tie it to the `Action` `Movie Poster`.

Now when a viewer redeems the Movie Poster reward they will see their profile picture popup on stream with their username and a random movie title.
